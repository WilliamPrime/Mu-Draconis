![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e097807d-2c92-4aad-aff6-419cdd0ac673)


the goals of the printer:

+ an affordable (sub 300$) polar 3d printer
+ modern hardware and components, alot of the older polar 3d printers run on marlin which isnt as nice to use as klipper so i will aim to make my printer use klipper
+ in terms of what sort of build volume i want, the bigger the better however i dont want it to be too large otherwise the mass of the bed will quickly become excessive making it slow , so i will try aim for a bed size of 200mm
