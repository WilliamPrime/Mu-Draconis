pitch, make a polar 3d printer, not because its practical, but because its something different :D


i would be taking inspiration from this, but making it more functional
https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/16dsugh/received_a_ton_of_constructive_criticism_on_my/

i want this to look very clean, probably be control only via klipper, no phyiscal controls

im still deciding if i want to have a heated bed or not, or if i want it to be a "fast" polar printer and use a nema 34 on the bed or something like that

the gantry should also be fairly easy to remove for shipping, so xt-60 connectors and other jst things will be needed to make sure that all the cables are easily detachable

also had the idea of having suction cup style things on the base so it sticks down to a table, its just a funny idea

**so far i have some parts ive found and extracted out of dead 3d printers:**
- ras pi 4 8gb
- big tree tech skr mini E3 (the mosfets for heaters and fans are dead, but stepper drivers still work)
- voron klipper expansion board
- hardmount v6 style hotend
- 70w 24v heater cartridge
- 40w 24v heater cartridge

im hopeing i can use them without them counting towards the cost of the BOM

# **first two days of planning, around 4hours into it**:
ive decided quite a bit about my printer
i want to use a 220mm round heated bed
i want to use a slip ring so i can get power to the bed and have a heated bed on this printer
i plan to use linear rods and linear bearing for both the x and z
the x will 100% be belted
im still deciding if the z should be belted or use a lead screw
i also started to model out some of the components i plan to use in fusion 360, such as the bed as a starting point
however it appears the technical drawing from the manufacturer REALLY isnt accurate
